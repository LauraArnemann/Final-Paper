\section{The surveys }
In August 2018, we asked economic experts from the World
Economic Survey (WES) on their views about the financial
entrenchment following the European debt crisis. The WES was a quarterly
survey conducted by the ifo Institute (it was stopped in 2020). The WES sample includes 517
participants from EU member countries, among them 90 experts from program countries.
The survey regularly includes questions about overall economic development
from European and non-European experts such as economic growth and
inflation. The WES in August 2018 included our
questions on the European debt crisis (see the Appendix for the
questionnaire). \footnote{Scholars use the WES to include special modules. See, for example, \cite{mosler}.}

We asked non-experts by using the website
prolific.co. In contrast to other crowdsourcing platforms such as Mturk,
Prolific is a platform specifically designed to recruit participants for
academic research.\footnote{\cite{Peer} show that participants from
the platform prolific perform better than participants from other
crowdsourcing platforms.} In exchange for their participation in surveys or
experiments, participants receive a financial reward. The survey was
distributed to 1702 participants in August 2019, 498 of these participants
came from program countries. To ensure that our participants had an
opportunity to actively remember the events during the European debt crisis
we restrict our sample to include only participants older than 25.

The same questions were used in both surveys, and in
unchanged ordering. The appendix shows the country composition of survey
participants for both samples.\footnote{%
The WES sample and the prolific sample differ. The differences are based on the expert status of members
of the WES sample. The majority of participants from the prolific sample,
around 65 percent are younger than 35, whereas the majority of participants
from the WES sample are between 35 and 55. Participants from the WES sample
also have a higher level of education than participants from the
prolific sample, 60 percent of participants hold a PhD. Nonetheless the
majority of participants from the prolific sample have completed tertiary
education. More than 80 percent of WES participants are male, whereas in the
prolific sample there is an equal share of men and women.} We refer to the
WES sample as the expert sample and to the prolific sample as the non-expert
sample.
